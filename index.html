            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>Goals give more direction to our daily life. When we set goals, we focus more on the things we really
                want, because our brain is easily distracted. We often set too many big goals, so we lose sight of them.

            <h1>Know your Global Community</h1>
            <p class="text-global">When I left Minnesota in the 1990s to attend college on the east coast, I was excited
                because I knew that
                I would experience a multitude of cultures that did not exist or were barely visible in Minnesota. In an
                urban setting like Minneapolis and St. Paul, it was not uncommon to enter a Target store or visit a
                museum or a local library and see that Minnesota was primarily inhabited by people of northern European
                origin.</p>
